This is the todo list for the goworker project.  These are like the TODO notes
inlined in the source code but more general:

1. Add DDFS reader (ddfs write should just work).
2. Let the job options be expressed in the worker (e.g. saveinfo).
3. Test with more than one task for each stage
4. Cleanup the way the inputs of a stage are sorted and maybe create a library for it.
5. Add more examples
6. Add the pipeline worker.
